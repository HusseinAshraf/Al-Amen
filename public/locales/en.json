We offer various types, whether ground grass or wall grass, in all its colors and diverse densities, which are chosen according to the customer's opinion with the instructions of the specialized engineer to determine the location where the grass is to be installed. The installation of artificial grass differs inside homes from gardens of homes, palaces, and villas, public gardens, and clubs. Wall grass and low-density grass are preferred inside homes, while medium-density grass is installed in gardens of homes, palaces, and villas. High-density grass is used in clubs and public gardens to withstand pressure. The company does not rely on one fixed method of installation but innovates everything new and modern to appear appropriate and attractive, captivating eyes and enchanting hearts. It is cut into beautiful shapes that suit the customer's taste, such as square and circular shapes, making the garden an artistic painting of great beauty. Al-Ameen Landscaping relies in its work on the best tools and wonderful technological devices to measure spaces, compact the ground, and install grass with great precision and speed."

We use many different materials in making waterfalls, such as (stones, porcelain, ceramic, marble, and others). The type, shape, and material used in making the waterfall are chosen based on the customer's desire and choice. Al-Ameen Landscaping offers its strongest offers and best prices for waterfalls. Some may think that designing and installing artificial waterfalls requires large spaces and a lot of money, but this belief is wrong. Waterfalls can be installed anywhere inside and outside homes, in any available space. The company provides several different sizes (small - medium - large) to suit various spaces. If the space is not suitable for installing a waterfall, a suspended or wall waterfall is designed, which is installed on walls and only needs a small basin to pour its water."
